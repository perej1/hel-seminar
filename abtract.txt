Title:
On the Impact of Approximation Errors on Extreme Value Inference: Applications
to Multidimensional Extremes

Abstract:
Multidimensional extremes can be analyzed in a univariate setting by applying an
appropriate functional to the observations. The chosen functional, which
measures the extremity of an observation, depends on the context. Furthermore,
the described approach often induces errors in the mapped univariate
observations. In this presentation, we study the effect of approximation errors
in assessing the extreme behavior of heavy-tailed random objects. As
applications, we consider elliptical extreme quantile region estimation and
extreme quantile estimation based on approximated Lp-norms corresponding to
realizations of a stochastic process.
